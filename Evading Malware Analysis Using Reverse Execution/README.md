- Evading Malware Analysis Using Reverse Execution


## Abstract

- Malware is a security threat, and various means are
adapted to detect and block them. In this paper, we demonstrate 
a method where malware can evade malware analysis. The
method is based on single-step reverse execution of code using
the self-debugging feature. We discuss how self-debugging code
works and use that to derive reverse execution for any payload.
Further, we demonstrate the feasibility of a detection evading
malware through a real implementation that targets Linux x86-
64 architecture for a reference implementation. The reference
implementation produces one result when run in one direction
and a different result when run in the reverse direction.
